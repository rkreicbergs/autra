About.historyText      = AuTra training application is based on AUT (Aural Attention Training) - a training program developed for a scientific research project on aural attention. The initial AUT version (created in 2009) was a part of the project's pilot phase and was tested on 25 primary school students. AUT version 2 (created in 2012) was used to finish the research project and was tested on 85 children, 7-8 years old. After analyzing the successful result of the project, AuTra was created in 2014 as a digital learning material for primary and high school children.
